# Matrix
### Color an LED matrix in real-time.

Leverages the MQTT protocol using Mosca, MQTT.js, and Paho Python.

Broken into 3 main applications:

1. **MQTT/UI Server**
    * Single Node.js application with two main functions:
        1. Run a Mosca MQTT broker.
        2. Serve web pages using Express.
            * Each UI client subscribes to the Mosca broker.
    * Start with ```npm start```.
        * Remember to ```npm install```.
        * Requires a local instance of MongoDB
2. **LED Client**
    * Raspberry Pi client which subscribes to the Mosca broker.
    * Controls an 8x8 RGB LED matrix.
    * Start with ```python app.py```.
        * Requires Python 3.6 and dependencies in Pipfile.
        * Run ```pipenv install``` to install dependencies.
3. **Stream Server**
    * Streams live video of the LED matrix to the UI clients.
    * Runs on the same Raspberry Pi as the LED client.
    * Start with ```npm start```.
        * Remember to ```npm install```.
